# SVG-Generator

## Description

This SVG logo generator successfully accomplishes the goal of quickly and easily, with the click of a few buttons, creating a simple logo featuring a basic shape and some text. This project was built to alleviate the annoyance of said task. I am not well-versed in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or the like and, therefore, being able to generate a logo with ease is something that I've always wondered about. Now, anyone can do so with this very application and I am proud to present it to you. I learned all about the importance of classes in Node.js.

## Installation

To use the application, you must have a code editor installed to your system such as VSCode. Additionally, you will need to install Node.js as well. To verify this was done correctly, run 'npm i' in the terminal. Following this, run 'npm i inquirer' to get you set up completely for generating your own logo!

## Usage

All there is to using the application is typing 'node index.js' into the terminal and answering the presented questions. Below is a video tutorial:
